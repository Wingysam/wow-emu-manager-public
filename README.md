# WoW-Emu-Manager (The Public Version)

### \[ A Web UI / management thing for CMaNGOS, written in Python \]

> **WARNING:** This repository contains work-in-progress stuffssss~ and one of the developersss~ is a wild Snekk, you've been warned. :hisssss:


#### # About:
Simple, monochrome layer between players, you and server's database.


#### # Requirements:
- [Python 3.6+][python]
- [Tornado 5+][tornado]
<!-- - [MySQL-Connector-Python 8.1+][connector] -->

**P.S.** In theory, it will run anywhere you can install Python 3 and the libs listed above.
Although, minimal python version is chosen with assumption of what Ubuntu 18.04 (thanks, Repology!) might have in their repos.

**P.P.S.** It, probably, will run on Windows just fine. But don't expect any dedicated support for it~.
