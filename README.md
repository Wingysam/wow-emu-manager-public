# WoW-Emu-Manager

### \[ A CMaNGOS management Web UI, written in Python \]

<!--
**WARNING:** This repository contains work-in-progress stuffssss~ and one of the developersss~ is a wild Snekk, you've been warned. :hisssss:
-->

#### # About:
Simple, nostalgic-looking layer between players, you and server's database written in Python 3 and Tornado.


#### # Requirements:
- [Python 3+][python]
- [Tornado 5+][tornado]
- [MySQL-Connector-Python 8+][connector]

P.S. In theory, it will run anywhere you can install Python 3 and the libs listed above.
However, we don't support any **particular** Linux distro _yet_. Give us a reason to! `<3`

There should be no problems running on windows, though, <!-- as much as i hate to say it --> because python on windows
means pip / setuptools in most cases, which means -- fresh packages!


#### # How to Contribute:

<!-- Does this statement contradict somehow with the one at the beginning of the section? :D -->

Our internal git workflow is to push work to personal branches first (`unstable_*`), then do a PR against `stable`.
Polluting public repo with topic branches is allowed but discouraged.
